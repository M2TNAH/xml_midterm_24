## Encoding the _Exeter Book Riddles_ : Approaching the Whims of the Skies in Old English poetry ‚òÅÔ∏è

## üé≤ The Exeter Book Riddles 

The Exeter Book is a tenth-century codex containing a rich anthology of Old English literature. It is believed to have been given to Exeter Cathedral by Leofric, the first bishop of Exeter. Among its various components, the Exeter Book contains about ninety-four verse riddles in Old English. Several of these poetic texts offer an insight into the Old English approach to the sky, with perspectives ranging from the physical to the spiritual. The language of the poems suggests that they were recited out loud in early medieval England. In some cases, the object described in the riddle is given a voice and describes itself for the reader or audience. However, the Exeter Book Riddles never directly reveal the solutions to the enigmas. The date of composition of the riddles is unknown, but it certainly predates the composition of the Exeter Book, which contains evidence showing that the riddles were being copied from other manuscripts.

Some of these riddles are original Old English creations, while others emanate directly from Latin texts. They are written, like most Old English poetry, in alliterative verse and display other characteristics of Old English verse such as the use of _kennings_. These _kennings_ are metaphorical compound nouns which sometimes hold the key to the riddle's meaning, but their semantic range often allows for several interpretations. These _kennings_ appear frequently in Old English literature, but are particularly important in poetry. For example, in _The_ _Phoenix_, "heofones gim" [heaven's jewel] refers to the sun. In _Beowulf_, the "hronrade" [whale-road] refers to the sea.

This abundance of metaphorical language and the precision with which alliterative patterns are constructed in the _Exeter Book Riddles_ make them a very suitable, and enjoyable, object of study for this project.

For the purpose of this project, I am using Tupper's 1910 edition of the _Exeter Book Riddles_.

## üåê Overview of the project 

This project aims to encode six Old English Exeter Book riddles associated to early English perceptions of the sky or related imagery (the sun, the moon, heaven). It aims to outline the poetic structure of these texts and highlight the alliteration patterns which characterise Old English poetry.
